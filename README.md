# Tic Tac Toe
TDD Example of Tic Tac Toe

To get started, from command line:

1. clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/chriswright47/tic_tac_toe.git`
1. change into project directory with `cd tic_tac_toe`
1. install rspec gem with `gem install rspec`
1. run test suite: `rspec spec`
1. To play the game: `ruby run.rb`


For Ruby learning time:
Week One: 2017-05-24
 - Get a simple command line game set up
 
Further work ideas:
 - More robust input validation and/or error handling
 - Artificial Intelligence for a computer player (this itself could be several iterations. e.g. iteration 1: random moves, iteration 2: smarter moves, iteration 3: optimal move)
 - Web UI instead of command line? Use JS framework?
 - Many more things are probably possible... :)
